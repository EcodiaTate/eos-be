"""
EcodiaOS -- Federation Threat Intelligence (Layer 4: Economic Immune System)

Manages broadcast and reception of threat advisories between federated EOS
instances. When one instance discovers a bad contract, rug-pull pattern, or
compromised protocol, it warns its peers -- and they can act before capital
is lost.

Trust-gated delivery rules:
  PARTNER / ALLY   -- accept immediately, apply blacklist
  COLLEAGUE        -- accept with recommendation to verify
  ACQUAINTANCE     -- verify signature before accepting
  NONE             -- skip entirely (no trust established)

Advisory signing uses the same Ed25519 keypair from IdentityManager.
