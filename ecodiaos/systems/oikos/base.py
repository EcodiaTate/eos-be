"""
EcodiaOS — Oikos Strategy ABCs (NeuroplasticityBus targets)

These abstract base classes define the hot-swappable strategies that Evo
can evolve at runtime via the NeuroplasticityBus. When a new subclass of
BaseCostModel is discovered in an evolved file, the bus instantiates it
and swaps it into the live OikosService without restart.

Design rules:
  - Zero-arg constructable (all state rebuilt from scratch on hot-swap)
  - Pure computation, no I/O
  - Stateless between calls (the service holds all state)
