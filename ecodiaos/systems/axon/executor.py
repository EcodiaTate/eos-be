EcodiaOS — Axon Executor ABC

All action executors implement this interface.

An Executor is a stateless (or near-stateless) handler for one category of action.
It knows:
  - What action type it handles (action_type)
  - How to validate parameters for that action (validate_params)
  - How to perform the action (execute)
  - Whether it can undo the action (rollback, if reversible=True)

Executors are registered with the ExecutorRegistry at startup.
They receive an ExecutionContext that carries credentials, intent, and affect
state — but they must not mutate it.

Design principle: an Executor does exactly one thing, precisely, reliably.
The deliberation (what to do) happens in Nova. The judgement (whether to do it)
happens in Equor. Axon just does it.
