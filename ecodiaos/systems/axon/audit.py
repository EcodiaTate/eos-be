EcodiaOS — Axon Audit Logger

Every action Axon takes is permanently recorded. This is the Honesty drive
at the action layer — the community can always trace what EOS did, when, why,
and what happened.

Audit records are stored in the Memory graph as GovernanceRecord nodes, making
them available for:
  - Equor drift analysis (detecting patterns of constitutional deviation)
  - Evo learning (correlating actions with outcomes)
  - Human oversight and governance review
  - Debugging and incident investigation

The audit logger is async and fire-and-forget from the pipeline's perspective —
it runs concurrently with outcome delivery, adding ≤20ms to total execution time.

Parameters are NEVER logged raw — only their SHA-256 hash is stored.
This protects sensitive data while still enabling deduplication and correlation.
