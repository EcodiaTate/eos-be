EcodiaOS — Thread: The Narrative Identity System

Thread is the organism's autobiographical self — the Ricoeurian ipse that
maintains continuity through change. It manages:
  - Identity schemas (who I am, what I value, what I've learned)
  - Constitutional commitments (the four drives as lived promises)
  - 29-dimensional identity fingerprints (for drift detection)
  - Life story integration (periodic autobiographical synthesis)
  - Narrative chapters (life phases the organism recognises in itself)
