EcodiaOS — Thread Processor ABCs

Abstract base classes for the Thread system's hot-reloadable processors.
The NeuroplasticityBus discovers subclasses of these ABCs in evolved files
and swaps the live instances on ThreadService atomically.

Two ABCs:
  BaseNarrativeSynthesizer — first-person autobiography composition
  BaseChapterDetector      — chapter boundary detection in experience stream

Evolved subclasses must preserve the contracts defined here. State that
must survive a hot-swap (e.g. the surprise accumulator) is owned by
ThreadService, not the processor — so swapping the processor never causes
the organism to forget its current narrative chapter.
