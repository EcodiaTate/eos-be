EcodiaOS — Simula Phase 2 Invariant Discovery Types

Four invariant classes targeting what cannot easily be hidden or transformed —
the "physics" of digital systems:

  1. Semantic Invariants   — output stability and decision boundary preservation
  2. State Invariants      — structural data relationships that must always hold
  3. Trust Invariants      — identity authority relationships and delegation chains
  4. Physical Invariants   — conservation laws, process bounds, feasibility constraints

Each class extends DiscoveredInvariant with domain-specific evidence fields.
All are Z3-checkable where possible; where not (physical feasibility), they
fall back to runtime witness collection + statistical bound checking.
