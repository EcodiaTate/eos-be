EcodiaOS -- Simula Phase 3 Decision Reliance Types

Three reliance classes targeting where decisions trust belief over verification --
the attack surface of deferred re-validation:

  1. State Interpretation   -- decisions that depend on stored/cached state
                               without re-validating the underlying assumption
  2. Source-of-Truth Gaps   -- divergence between live truth, stored truth,
                               and inferred truth at the point of a decision
  3. Session Continuity     -- assumptions that must persist across steps for
                               a multi-step workflow to proceed correctly

Each class extends PhaseInvariant with domain-specific evidence fields.
Z3-checkable where the reliance can be encoded as a constraint.
Where not (temporal divergence, multi-step narrative), evidence falls back
to STRUCTURAL_ANALYSIS + RUNTIME_WITNESS.

Phase 3 answers: "What must the decision-maker believe for this action to go
                  through? Is that belief verified, or just remembered?"
