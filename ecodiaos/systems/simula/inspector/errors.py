"""
EcodiaOS -- Inspector Error Hierarchy

All exceptions raised within the Inspector vulnerability-discovery pipeline.

Namespace: ecodiaos.systems.simula.inspector.errors
Distinct from: ecodiaos.systems.simula.errors  (self-evolution errors)

Inspector errors are NEVER routed to Thymos or the evolution pipeline.
Failures are recorded via InspectorAnalyticsEmitter (hunt_error event)
and structlog. The hunt continues or aborts cleanly; the EOS cognitive
cycle is never disrupted.
