EcodiaOS — Inspector Scope Enforcement

Provides BountyScope and ScopeEnforcer to restrict TargetIngestor scanning to
paths explicitly authorised by Bug Bounty Rules of Engagement.

Design rules (strict, in priority order):
  1. Any path matching an out_of_scope_paths pattern → DENY (regardless of in-scope rules).
  2. If in_scope_paths is empty → ALLOW (default-allow when no allowlist is defined).
  3. Any path matching at least one in_scope_paths pattern → ALLOW.
  4. Otherwise → DENY.

Regex patterns are compiled at construction time. Malformed patterns raise
ValueError immediately so callers discover misconfiguration early.
