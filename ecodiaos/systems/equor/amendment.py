EcodiaOS — Equor Amendment Process

The most serious governance mechanism: changing the constitutional drives.
Requires deliberation, impact assessment, supermajority vote, and cooldown.

No drive can be set to zero. No drive can exceed 3.0.
Combined weights must stay within [3.0, 5.0].
Amendment history is immutable.
