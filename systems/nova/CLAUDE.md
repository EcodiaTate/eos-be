# Nova — CLAUDE.md

**Spec:** `.claude/EcodiaOS_Spec_05_Nova.md` (v1.2, 2026-03-07)
**System ID:** `nova`
**Role:** Decision & Planning Executive. Converts workspace broadcasts into approved Intents. Nova proposes; the organism disposes. Equor can deny, Axon can fail, community can override.

---

## Architecture

**Lifecycle:** `initialize()` → `receive_broadcast()` → dual-process deliberation → Intent → Equor review → route to Axon/Voxis → `process_outcome()` → feedback

**Core modules:**
| Module | File | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `BeliefUpdater` | `belief_updater.py` | World model from broadcasts; Bayesian confidence accumulation |
| `GoalManager` | `goal_manager.py` | Active goals with dynamic priority formula |
| `DeliberationEngine` | `deliberation_engine.py` | Dual-process fast/slow routing |
| `PolicyGenerator` | `policy_generator.py` | LLM-based candidate generation (slow path) |
| `EFEEvaluator` | `efe_evaluator.py` | Expected Free Energy scoring per policy |
| `IntentRouter` | `intent_router.py` | Dispatches approved Intents to Axon or Voxis |
| `GoalStore` | `goal_store.py` | Neo4j persistence; loads on startup, suppresses stale maintenance goals |

---

## Dual-Process Deliberation

**Fast path (System 1, ≤200ms):**
- Trigger: novelty < 0.6, risk < 0.5, emotion < 0.7
- Pattern-match against static procedure templates (~10–20); ≤100ms match + ≤50ms Equor
- If Equor denies → escalate to slow path

**Slow path (System 2, ≤15s):**
- Trigger: novelty ≥ 0.6, risk ≥ 0.5, emotion ≥ 0.7, belief conflict, or precision ≥ 0.8
- LLM generates 2–5 policies; EFE evaluation selects minimum
- Always includes do-nothing policy (fixed EFE: −0.10)
- Retries next-best if Equor denies

**Do-nothing policy** wins when: ambiguous, risk > wait cost, or observation has epistemic value. Expresses metabolic restraint — treat `fe_budget_nats` as designed precariousness, not a limit to work around.

---

## EFE & Goal Priority

**Goal priority formula:**
```
priority = (base_importance × 0.30) + (urgency × 0.25) + (drive_resonance × 0.20)
         + (staleness_boost × 0.10) + (dep_factor × 0.15)
```

**VFE (Variational Free Energy):**
```
VFE ≈ Σ_i (1 - confidence_i) × salience_i
```
Lower VFE = better beliefs. Impacts feasibility scores.

**Bayesian confidence update:**
```
confidence_new = confidence_old + precision × (1 - confidence_old)
```

Belief state persisted to Neo4j as `(:EntityBelief)` nodes (batched UNWIND, max 1 tx per 10 changes). Restored on startup via `restore_from_neo4j()`. Entity beliefs decay; pruned below 0.05.

### Thompson Sampler — Safety Layer Integration (Round 3B, 2026-03-07)

**`ThompsonSampler.get_success_rate(model="re") -> float`** — returns Beta posterior mean for the specified model arm. Called by:
- `persist_to_redis()` — writes `eos:re:success_rate_7d` + `eos:re:thompson_success_rate` after every Beta update
- `NovaService._on_axon_execution_result()` — reads rate for `RE_DECISION_OUTCOME` payload

**`ThompsonSampler.persist_to_redis(redis)`** — now writes two additional keys on every persist:
- `eos:re:success_rate_7d` — canonical key consumed by `RESuccessRateMonitor` kill switch and `ContinualLearningOrchestrator` degradation trigger
- `eos:re:thompson_success_rate` — legacy compat key (same value)

**`PolicyGenerator.record_outcome(intent_id, success, redis=None)`** — wrapper method called by `NovaService._on_axon_execution_result()`. Routes to `ThompsonSampler.record_outcome(_last_model_used, success)` then fire-and-forgets `persist_to_redis(redis)` if redis provided. This replaces the direct sampler access pattern in the service.

## What's Missing / Open Gaps

All 7 gaps resolved as of 2026-03-07. See Resolved section below.

**RESOLVED (2026-03-07 — this session):**

- ✅ `DecisionRecord` written to Neo4j as `(:Decision)` node — `_persist_decision_record()` fires fire-and-forget from `_record_decision()`; links `[:MOTIVATED_BY]` to `(:Goal)` when goal_id is set
- ✅ Redis Stream emission — `re_training_queue` populated when `re_training_eligible=True`; Redis accessed via `memory._redis` or `synapse._redis`
- ✅ Thompson sampler routing — `ThompsonSampler` class in `policy_generator.py`; Beta-Bernoulli conjugate; `PolicyGenerator` routes to RE when sampler wins and `re_client` is wired; state persisted to Redis key `nova:thompson_sampler`
- ✅ **RE client wired (2026-03-07)** — `ReasoningEngineService` (vLLM wrapper) created in `registry._init_reasoning_engine()`, passed as `re_client` to `PolicyGenerator`, `sampler.set_re_ready(True)` called when `re_service.is_available`; Claude-only if vLLM unreachable or `ECODIAOS_RE_ENABLED=false`
- ✅ Thread integration — `set_thread()` method added; `THREAD_COMMIT_REQUEST` emitted via `_emit_thread_commit_request()` at end of `process_outcome()` for every resolved intent
- ✅ Multi-goal conflict detection — `detect_conflicts()` added to `GoalManager`; 2 heuristics (drive opposition, criteria textual contradiction); called every 100 broadcasts; conflicts emit `GOAL_CONFLICT_DETECTED` events
- ✅ Procedure template induction — successful slow-path decisions (EFE < −0.3, intent dispatched) persisted as `(:Procedure)` nodes in Neo4j via `_induce_procedure_from_record()`; loaded back into `_DYNAMIC_PROCEDURES` via `_load_induced_procedures()` on startup
- ✅ `GOAL_OVERRIDE` implemented — `_on_goal_override()` handler subscribed in `set_synapse()`; validates payload (description, source, importance ∈ [0,1]); creates `Goal(source=GOVERNANCE)`; emits `GOAL_ACCEPTED` or `GOAL_REJECTED`

**RESOLVED (2026-03-07 — prior session):**

- ✅ `HYPOTHESIS_UPDATE` subscription + handler — EFE weight priors now adjust from Evo tournament outcomes
- ✅ `GOAL_ACHIEVED` / `GOAL_ABANDONED` emitted — goal lifecycle now visible on Synapse bus
- ✅ `BUDGET_PRESSURE` emitted at 60% threshold — Nova's metabolic load now visible to Soma before full exhaustion
- ✅ `INTENT_SUBMITTED` / `INTENT_ROUTED` emitted — Intent lifecycle now fully visible on bus
- ✅ `re_training_eligible: bool` and `model_used: str` added to `DecisionRecord` — set for slow-path intents
- ✅ `HYPOTHESIS_FEEDBACK` emitted for ALL slow-path outcomes (not just tournament-tagged)
- ✅ Graded `actual_pragmatic` — continuous [0.0, 1.0] signal replacing binary flip (2026-03-07)
- ✅ `self._memory._neo4j` all 4 direct-access sites replaced with public API (2026-03-07)
- ✅ Equor-unavailable fallback — `asyncio.wait_for()` + DEFERRED verdict + Thymos incident (2026-03-07)
- ✅ `ONEIROS_CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE` subscription + belief refresh handler (2026-03-07)
- ✅ Dead code D1 + D2 removed (2026-03-07)
- ✅ `NovaConfig` field names aligned with spec §12 (2026-03-07)

---

## Known Issues / Architecture Violations

- **AV3:** Runtime cross-system import `from systems.memory.episodic import store_counterfactual_episode` at call time — replaced with `self._memory.store_counterfactual_episode()` public API call (2026-03-07, low priority)
- **`process_outcome()` ≤100ms budget** — likely too tight; involves Neo4j writes, regret computation, Evo feedback; no enforcement mechanism

---

## Key Constraints

- Equor bypass ("emergency skip") is never acceptable — use do-nothing policy + audit log + time cap
- Slow-path 15s ceiling is a current operational target tied to Claude API; will shrink to ≤2s when RE operational
- Beliefs must persist through restarts — never accumulate beliefs in memory-only structures
- `GoalStore` suppresses stale maintenance goals on load — do not remove this logic
- All Memory writes go via Synapse events — no `_memory._neo4j` direct access in new code
