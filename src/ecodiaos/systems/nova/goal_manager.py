EcodiaOS — Nova Goal Manager

Goals are not tasks — they are desires. They have dynamic priorities that
shift with context, dependencies that create sequencing, and progress
tracking that knows when to celebrate or abandon.

Priority computation follows the spec exactly:
    priority = base_importance × 0.30
             + urgency_factor   × 0.25
             + drive_resonance  × 0.20
             + staleness_boost  (up to 0.10)
             + dep_factor       × 0.15

Drive resonance is the key theoretical innovation: goals aligned with
currently activated drives get a context-sensitive boost. This means a
care-aligned goal is more urgent when EOS detects distress, and a
growth-aligned goal is more salient when curiosity is high.
